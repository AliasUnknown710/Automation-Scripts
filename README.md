## üß† Why This Repo Matters

These scripts demonstrate practical automation skills across platforms:
- System cleanup and maintenance
- File archiving and rotation
- Security auditing and monitoring
- Infrastructure scripting and deployment
- Real-world troubleshooting and resilience

Each script is minimal, actionable, and built for real-world use‚Äînot toy problems.

## üöÄ Usage

- Customize paths and thresholds to match your environment.
- Schedule via `cron` (Linux) or Task Scheduler (Windows).
- Run manually or integrate into larger workflows.
- Containerize with Docker or install via script.
